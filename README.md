Update Log

2014-12-31
- Used the SpaceJunk Example to generate a colored cubex

2015-01-05
- Implemented (slightly) turning of two cubelets about an axis upon a key press. rotateZ is still glitched, however.
- Full Rubik's Cube created with black border.

2015-01-06
- Fixed annoying flickering issue on the cube.

2015-01-07
- U-Turn attempted to implement.
- The cube is now made to draw initially only once.

2015-01-08
- Fixed issue of cube not being centered on axes. (U-turn still not working properly. Still some bugs in cube rotations.)
- A PVector was used instead of shiftX.

2015-01-09
- Created an array for the cube's colors to check if the cube is solved.
- Bug fixed that made animation not appear; but doesn't run now with while loop.

2015-01-12
- Converted vertices to arrays of floats.
- Implementing a 3D array instead.
- New structure now works when rotating 1 degree at a time.

2015-01-13
- A right face turn was implemented.
- Center realigned to actual center; simultaneous turns and multiple turns taken care of.

2015-01-14
- Created a function that will swap the cubies correspondingly.
- All turns implemented, X rotation working.
- Black outline for cube working.
- All cube turns and cube rotations are now fully functional.
- Fixed a bug in which the nonvisible parts of the parts were also showing colors.
 2015-01-15
 - Function created to generate a random move sequence. The actual graphical scrambling is bugged, however.
